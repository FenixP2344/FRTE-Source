[QSZ92HG]
Description=The QSZ92 pistol was originally proposed to be equipped with a 9mm pistol for officers below the battalion level and a 5.8mm pistol for officers above the regiment level during the argumentation. But after several years of comparison, the military decided in 2005 to only equip the 5.8mm pistol, while the 9mm pistol was mainly equipped for police. The military's consideration for this is mainly due to the following reasons: the 5.8mm pistol has a very high shooting accuracy, and due to its low recoil, the muzzle jumps slightly, resulting in a relatively dense dispersion during rapid shooting. In addition, it has a capacity of 20 rounds and the ability to easily penetrate bulletproof vests (the national standard IV level is roughly equivalent to the old NIJ IIIA level or the new NIJ HG2 level), making it more effective in combat against protected targets, and its reliability during use is high. However, the police attach great importance to the stopping effect of the 9mm pistol bullet, and the penetration ability of the 5.8mm pistol bullet is also a bit too strong, which is not suitable for urban law enforcement environments, such as it may penetrate multiple obstacles and cause accidental injuries to the public.

Description=This infamous machine pistol was developed by Intratec, a Miami offshoot of the Swedish company Interdynamic. While it has relatively poor stopping power compared to full-sized submachine guns, its highly concealable form factor and ease of converting to full-auto makes it the weapon of choice for drive-bys and gang shootings. The TEC-DC9 received considerable noteriety in American media after the Columbine and Cleveland school shootings. After these events, the weapon was banned in several states by name and Intratec went bankrupt. Despite being a criminal weapon, a flashlight has been added for better tactical use in dark areas.

The 7.62mm heavy warhead is more effective than the 5.45mm heavy warhead. The equipment of AK-15 is used to replace the AKM/AKMS, AK-103, and AK-104 in these units. Like its predecessors, the AK-15 can use the 7.62 × 39mm YC special projectile with subsonic heavy warheads and is paired with a silencer. But unlike its predecessors, the AK-15's muffler has a quick loading and unloading function, which can be directly installed on the muzzle brake without the need to disassemble the muzzle brake before installing the muffler.

It has a slower rate of fire and lower muzzle velocity than the Colt M4A1, but uses a higher caliber bullet which makes it comparable to its American counterpart at short ranges.

[AK74sutMG]
Description=The AK-74 was developed as a response to design criticisms of the AK-47 and AKM rifles. Particularly, it dropped the 7.62x39mm ammunition down to 5.45x39mm in order to address concerns that the bullets overpenetrated their targets, a chrome-lined barrel bore to reduce maintenance, and a set of brackets for underbarrel attachments. This particular model, a carbine variant often called a ''Krinkov'', is equipped with a flashlight to make it more usable in tactical scenarios, and is more suited to close quarters combat.

[Taser]
Description=Stun guns work on the principle of Electro-Muscular Disruption (EMD).  This projectile model fires small electrodes into the target and then sends a powerful electric charge down the thin wires.  The EMD effect causes involuntary contraction of the target's muscle tissue regardless of an individual's pain tolerance or mental focus.  The effect is painful and demoralizing to even the most aggressive suspects.||EMD devices have three key drawbacks.  The first is that they have a relatively short range.  The second is that new electrodes must be loaded after each shot. Lastly, EMD poses numerous risks, including possible cardiac arrest in drug users, the elderly, or those with specific medical conditions.

The effect is painful and demoralizing to even the most aggressive suspects. The X2 can fire darts in groups of four or two separate groups of two. It can also be used in touch-stun mode as a melee weapon. An onboard computer records information on shock intensity and duration, among other factors.

To remind the operators that this particular weapon is only to be loaded with less than lethal ammunition, it has been painted green.||The beanbag ammunition provides a powerful blunt force impact on the target.

Description=The QSZ92 pistol was originally proposed to be equipped with a 9mm pistol for officers below the battalion level and a 5.8mm pistol for officers above the regiment level during the argumentation. But after several years of comparison, the military decided in 2005 to only equip the 5.8mm pistol, while the 9mm pistol was mainly equipped for police. The military's consideration for this is mainly due to the following reasons: the 5.8mm pistol has a very high shooting accuracy, and due to its low recoil, the muzzle jumps slightly, resulting in a relatively dense dispersion during rapid shooting. In addition, it has a capacity of 20 rounds and the ability to easily penetrate bulletproof vests (the national standard IV level is roughly equivalent to the old NIJ IIIA level or the new NIJ HG2 level), making it more effective in combat against protected targets, and its reliability during use is high. However, the police attach great importance to the stopping effect of the 9mm pistol bullet, and the penetration ability of the 5.8mm pistol bullet is also a bit too strong, which is not suitable for urban law enforcement environments, such as it may penetrate multiple obstacles and cause accidental injuries to the public.

[VP70HG_Shield]
Description=The HK VP70 pistol is a novel and structurally unique automatic pistol. Made by Heckler&Koch GmbH in Germany. When shooting with one hand, it can be used as a handgun; When the holster is used as a stock, it can be used as a submachine gun and can perform 3-round controlled firing. The production quantity of VP70 pistol is limited and has not yet been adopted by the military. The military version of the VP70 pistol is the VP70M, which is equipped with a shoulder rest (also serving as a holster) and can fire three rounds. The VP70Z pistol is a civilian type and can only perform semi-automatic shooting. The VP71 model is an improved version of the VP70, with no changes in its appearance. The main improvement is the elimination of the three shot firing mechanism. After installing a temporary stock, it can only fire semi-automatic.
